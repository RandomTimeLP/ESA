ESA - Enhanced Stream Alerts: A way to easily create advanced alerts for your stream.

Be aware: Usualy Github is used for Open-Source Project, due to it containing necesary private data it is only avaiable es closed source.

What exactly is ESA planned to be?</br>
ESA is developed to be an easy way to implement common events (like follows) and rather uncommon events (like switching songs in spotify) in to your stream.

It's design allows you to customize said alerts in a very extended but simple way. For example from simple things like fonts or background images to more crazy stuff like background and text animations that can respond to specific events like someone follows right as the next song starts to play.
